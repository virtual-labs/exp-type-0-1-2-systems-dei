        "a": "It is useful for study of transient responses (or time responses) of Linear Time-Invariant Systems (LTIS). ",
        "b": "It is also utilised to solve complex differential equations.",

      "question": "Why Transfer Function is always realised in S domain?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To calculate output y(t) of system in time domain the convolution of the input with the response signal is to be calculated. This makes it a complex process.",
        "b": "Mathematics involved in Transformation of the equation made the realization easier to understand.",
